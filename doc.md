Demographic stochasticity can generate “emergent” heterogeneity even in the absence of explicit differences between individual-based rates. In simple models, this heterogeneity can be characterized in including negative binomial funky distributions of activity. We explicate the notion that this is predictable (see Box)

![
__Heterogeneity emerges even from a simple, linearized compartmental model__ due to implicit variation in recovery times among infectors. (a) Activity distributions (density curves) and secondary case distributions (density histograms) for the outset of an SIR epidemic. (b) Inequality curves for _activity_ distributions from SIR models with differing \Ro\ are identical (and indestinguishable due to overplotting); inequality in the _case_ distribution decreases with R0 towards the theoretical limit of the activity distribution.

F2 But despite differences in a non-dynamic world, we find invariance in case-per-case when looking across the entire epidemic

+ Add the simple proof to the SI... or main text?

F3 What is the cause of this surprise? We claim: different relative contributions of variability from between and within-cohorts across R0

% Please add a narrative statement here so that I understand the flow
* Is this a sufficient replacement for the poster table (top R)?
* How to cut? The cohort-based approach may be better for understanding, observation-based approach may be more related to practical questions
TG: Can me make a note about for epidemics with large R0, if you don't start tracking cases right from the beginning, you'll already underestimate cases/case
