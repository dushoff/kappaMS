Demographic stochasticity can generate “emergent” heterogeneity even in the absence of explicit differences between individual-based rates. In simple models, this heterogeneity can be characterized in including negative binomial funky distributions of activity. We cite/elevate + (re)present the notion that this is predictable (see the Box)

F1 is based on top panels of legacy/outputs/plotPMF_PDF_ineq.Rout.pdf
![View counts per video, grouped by source, shown on a log scale. Each video is represented by a black dot. The red line shows the median, while blue lines signify the upper and lower quartiles. Sources are listed in decreasing order of coded videos. Some sources have videos that are not shown due to having less than 100,000 views: YouTubers (4.3% missing, minimum = 1,643), Educational (1.7% missing, minimum = 35,755), straight news (1.1% missing, minimum = 23,848)](legacy/outputs/plotPMF_PDF_ineq.Rout.pdf)

F2 But despite differences in a non-dynamic world, we find invariance in case-per-case when looking across the entire epidemic
this is the top L of legacy/figures/emergentHetPoster.pdf

+ Add the simple proof to the SI... or main text?

F3 What is the cause of this surprise? We claim: different relative contributions of variability from between and within-cohorts across R0

F4 is one of the new Rc plots, e.g., legacy/outputs/RcTimePlotVaryingPeak.Rout.pdf
% Please add a narrative statement here so that I understand the flow
* Is this a sufficient replacement for the poster table (top R)?
* How to cut? The cohort-based approach may be better for understanding, observation-based approach may be more related to practical questions
TG: Can me make a note about for epidemics with large R0, if you don't start tracking cases right from the beginning, you'll already underestimate cases/case
