Better introduction of our SIR framework? More clarity that we are:
* starting from an SIR framework
* neglecting depletion in F1

General: say “secondary case” more case-per-case less

F1
* Get rid of phantom dashed line in legend
* secondary cases
* explain or delete 20-80 guidelines
	* Replace with a point
* say “secondary case” and “activity” on RH legend
* make caption match descriptions

F3
* Fix 🙂
* Maybe stack?
* Maybe swap with F4
	* or not, depends how we want to tell the story

F0 Start with a time-series plot (F3A preceded by an unrescaled time plot)

Azadeh
* Draft an introduction based on overleaf
* Switch F3 and F4
* Add a short version of Tapan's proof as an appendix.

Jonathan
* Diagnose make problem? ✓
	* Not reproduced in fresh directory; continue to track
* Read through and think about changes (start with box)
* Look at bib file from emergentHeterogeneity
