If you clone this repo, it should work to say:
```
make Makefile
make updatedirs
make draft.pdf
```

It may also work to say `make draft.pdf.go` instead, and the document may even open itself automatically.

But this will do a lot of steps, and may not work. Maybe best not to worry about it right now.

You can just look at the [pdf document instead](outputs/draft.pdf), and edit doc.md without worrying about whether you can make things for now.
